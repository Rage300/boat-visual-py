# AutoMouseTemporary
A python program for displaying the position and heading information of an arduino controlled boat from a csv

1/2/25: Added to github from local machine with new .git and empty history. The program was created in June 2024.

The file name that you want to open must be specified in the py file.
As this program is likely dead, I may not end up fixing this and many other issues.
